abstract: Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) exhibit impaired reinforcement learning and deficits in social cognition (Acheson, Twamley & Young, 2013). Additionally, neurocognitive problems in attention, memory, and executive functioning have been observed to occur in approximately 70% of persons with schizophrenia (Palmer, Healter, Kuck, & Braff, 1997), which can impact learning. Nicotine has learning-enhancing effects (Acheson et al., 2013.) and smoking prevalence is elevated in among persons with SSDs (de Leon & Diaz, 2005). Specifically, the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been identified as a pro-cognitive target to augment reward-based learning in patients with schizophrenia (Acheson et al., 2013).Social Skills Training (SST) and Cognitive and Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) have shown to be effective forms of treatment for this population. Consumer of these interventions develop their social and cognitive abilities through skill-based curricula and positive feedback, resulting in skill acquisition and enhanced quality of life (Benton & Schroeder, 1990; Dixon et al., 2010; Granholm et al., 2013). To these authors’ knowledge, no study to date has explored the relationship between nicotine use and reward-based learning associated with SST and CBSST among this population. Since this has not been examined in this population/setting, feasibility (i.e., enrollment, dropout, number of assessments completed) was also evaluated. Results derived from this study may facilitate the development of the VASDHS’ CORE program by highlighting observed differences in learning between nicotine versus non-nicotine users, potentially leading to the modification and delivery of current group curriculum to bridge these differences and improve quality of life.
