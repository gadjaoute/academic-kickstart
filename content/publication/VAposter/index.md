## Introduction
Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) exhibit impaired reinforcement learning and deficits in social cognition (Acheson, Twamley & Young, 2013). Additionally, neurocognitive problems in attention, memory, and executive functioning have been observed to occur in approximately 70% of persons with schizophrenia (Palmer, Healter, Kuck, & Braff, 1997), which can impact learning. 

Nicotine has learning-enhancing effects (Acheson et al., 2013.) and smoking prevalence is elevated in among persons with SSDs (de Leon & Diaz, 2005). Specifically, the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been identified as a pro-cognitive target to augment reward-based learning in patients with schizophrenia (Acheson et al., 2013).

Social Skills Training (SST) and Cognitive and Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) have shown to be effective forms of treatment for this population. Consumer of these interventions develop their social and cognitive abilities through skill-based curricula and positive feedback, resulting in skill acquisition and enhanced quality of life (Benton & Schroeder, 1990; Dixon et al., 2010; Granholm et al., 2013). 

To these authors’ knowledge, no study to date has explored the relationship between nicotine use and reward-based learning associated with SST and CBSST among this population. Since this has not been examined in this population/setting, feasibility (i.e., enrollment, dropout, number of assessments completed) was also evaluated.

Results derived from this study may facilitate the development of the VASDHS’ CORE program by highlighting observed differences in learning between nicotine versus non-nicotine users, potentially leading to the modification and delivery of current group curriculum to bridge these differences and improve quality of life.

## Hypotheses

Veterans with SSDs who use nicotine will demonstrate better learning in SST and CBSST compared to non nicotine-users.

Nicotine-users will demonstrate better quality of life and self-efficacy post-treatment than non-users.

The study will demonstrate feasibility.

## Study Aims

Improve the clinical operations of the VA San Diego Healthcare’s (VASDHS) Center of Recovery Education (CORE) by observing potential differences in learning among Veterans (nicotine and non-nicotine users) enrolled in SST and/or CBSST groups, and the impact participating in these groups has on their quality of life.


## Methods 

Participants & Procedures
The relationship between reward learning and nicotine was explored in a sample of (N=15*) Veterans. Participants were members of the CORE who carry diagnoses of SSDs and related disorders with psychotic features. 

Veterans were enrolled in a weekly, 60-minute SST or CBSST groups for a range of 8-12 weeks. Veterans completed measures at the first and last session of their respective groups. All Veterans who identified as nicotine users were provided the opportunity to request a referral for smoking cessation services through the VASDHS’ tobacco use cessation clinic.

###Quantitative Measures

#### General

A basic demographics questionnaire was developed and administered.
Current and historical nicotine use/cravings, were assessed by the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI; Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, Rickert, & Robinson, 1989), the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence for Smokeless tobacco (FTND-ST; Ebbert, Patten, & Schroeder, 2006) and questions adapted from the brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-brief; Tiffany & Drobes, 1991).
The Quality of Life Scale (QOLS; Burckhardt & Anderson, 2003) was used as an assessment for psychosocial functioning (Hayes et al.1995; Liberman et al.,1998). 
The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE; Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) was used, as SST has been shown to reinforce the self-efficacy and willingness to use skills ( Kurtz & Mueser, 2008; Pratt, Mueser, Smith, & Lu, 2005).

#### Social Skills Training  

Standard clinical measures to assess SST-specific learning (pre/post), which are routinely collected as part of the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention’s (OMHSP) National Evidence-Based Psychotherapy Training Program (EBP Training Program), were administered. These measures include, The World Health Organization’s Quality of Life survey (WHO-QOL) and the Social Skills Training Veteran survey: Satisfaction, Self-efficacy & Competence in Social Skills (SSCS). 

#### Cognitive and Behavioral Social Skills Training

Cognitive Skills Module Test (CMT; Granholm, Holden & Mcquaid, 2016), was administered pre/post to evaluate the learning of the cognitive skills in CBSST.

#### Analytic Procedures

To examine the differences in pre/post scores between nicotine use status (user vs. non-user), a series of repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed for the self-reported post-SST treatment ratings of improvement in social skills.

## Results

There were no statistically significant differences in overall patient responses between the nicotine users and non-nicotine users. 
Pre/post scores from the GSE and QOLS were examined by nicotine use status (user vs non-user). Results did not yield statistically significant differences.

#### Social Skills Training

Pre/post scores from the sections of the SSCS that assess SST-specific learning and the QOL were examined by nicotine use status (user vs. non-user). Results did not yield statistically significant differences. A series of Mann-Whitney U tests measuring improvement in SST skills from the SSCS did not yield statistically significant differences pre/post between nicotine users and non-users

#### Cognitive and Behavioral Social Skills Training

Pre/post scores from the CMT were examined by nicotine use status (user vs non-user). Results did not yield significant differences, F(1, 2) = .14, p = .74.

#### Feasibility

Average group size for the CORE clinic is an n=6, thus we can conclude that we had good feasibility with an n=9 (CBSST) and n=6 (SST) for the groups. 
A total of 14 Veterans were approached to be in the study and 13 agreed to participate. There was a retention rate of 55.5% for SST and 66.67% for CBSST. There was a rate of 35.7% nicotine users across both groups.
